# Apps

Real Dev Squad has a suite of apps that are actively worked on. We learn and use a lot of technologies:
- Basic HTML, CSS, JS
- React / Next.js
- Ember
- Angular
- Node
- Go

## Naming Conventions

Each repo on [our Github organization](https://github.com/Real-Dev-Squad) looks like `website-<name-of-subdomain>`

Currently, we have the following apps:
