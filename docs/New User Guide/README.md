# Guide for New Users: Getting Assigned to Tasks

Welcome! This document will guide new contributors on how to get assigned with a task in RDS projects.

## Step 1: Choosing the task

Now that you have completed your lift simulation, you are all set to contribute to the projects. There are two ways to get assigned with a task:

1. **Finding on your own:**


   - If you find a bug or need an update, ask Ankush, Tejas, or Prakash if the task is needed.
   - Check the channels `new-tasks` or `i-am-idle` for tasks on discord.

2. **Directly Contacting Team Members:**
   - Reach out to Ankush, Tejas, or Prakash and inquire about available tasks.
   - Mention if you are looking for a task or if you have a specific area you want to work on.
   - If you're idle and don't have any specific task in mind, let the team know, and they will assign you a task.

## Step 1: Choose the Task

Congratulations on completing your lift simulation! Follow these steps to choose and get approval for a task:

1. **Approval from Project Lead:**

   - If you found a bug, need an update, or have an idea, get approval from Ankush, Tejas, or Prakash.
   - If you're unsure or idle, let them know you are ready for a task.

2. **Create a GitHub Issue:**

   - If the task is not created, create a new GitHub issue with a clear title and description.

3. **Add to Status Page:**

   - Visit the [Status Page](https://status.realdevsquad.com/issues).
   - Click on the 'Issues' tab and paste the GitHub issue title, then press 'Submit'.

4. **Request Task:**

   - On the Status Page, click 'Request as Task'.
   - Set a reasonable time limit for task completion, the time you will need to get your code to **production**. Once again, the time you entering here will be the time in which your code is in the **production** and ready to use(not any intermediary state).
   - After submitting, you will be redirected to a dashboard.
