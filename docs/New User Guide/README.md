# Guide for New Users: Getting Assigned to Tasks

Welcome! This document provides guidance for contributors on how to get assigned tasks in RDS projects.

## Step 1: Post Lift Simulation

After completing the lift simulation, developers can request a task from Ankush through the designated channel. This can be done in two ways: reporting a bug or expressing the need for an assigned task.

 **Bug Report or Task Request:**
   - If you find a bug or need a task, notify Ankush in the designated channel.
   - Check the channels `new-tasks` or `i-am-idle` on Discord for available tasks.

## Step 2: Task Assignment Process

Upon your request, Ankush will decide whether to assign you a task. If the GitHub issue for the task is already created, proceed to create a TCR (Task Creation Request). If not,first create an issue then create the TCR first and then seek approval from Ankush. Once approved, start working on the task.

1. **Create a TCR(Task creation request)**

   - Visit the [Status Page](https://status.realdevsquad.com/issues).
   - Click on the 'Issues' tab and paste the GitHub issue title, then press 'Submit'.
   - On the Status Page, click 'Request as Task'.
   - Set a reasonable time limit for task completion, the time you will need to get your code to **production**. Once again, the time you entering here will be the time in which your code is in the **production** and ready to use(not any intermediary state).
   - After submitting, you will be redirected to a dashboard.

2. **Copy Dashboard URL and Tag for Approval:**

   - Copy the dashboard URL.
   - Tag Ankush requesting approval using channels `new-tasks` or `i-am-idle` on discord.

   - And ask them to approve.

3. **Work on Approved Task:**
   - After Ankush's approval, start working on the assigned task.

4. **Seek Clarification When Needed:**
   - If you face difficulties, discuss them with Ankush, Application Owner, or Feature Owner.
   - Ensure alignment and correctness of your work.

5. **Resolve Doubts:**
   - If you have doubts, feel free to ask questions in the server's respective channel.
   - For specific technical doubts, ping Tejas or Prakash.
   - For doubts related to business logic, ping Ankush.

By following these steps, you are ready to contribute effectively to your assigned task. If you encounter any issues or have questions, don't hesitate to seek assistance in the appropriate channels.

Happy contributing!
