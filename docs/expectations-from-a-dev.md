Expectations from a Developer at Read Dev Squad

Hey! Chances are you are here because you have completed the Lift Simulation and are looking to contribute to Real Dev Squad via Features. 

At RDS we emulate a real startup-like work environment. Here are the expectations 

- When assigned a task the following are expected.
   - You are expected to provide a reasonable timeline for the task.
   - You are expected to complete your tasks on the deadline estimated and agreed upon by you, and you should provide constant updates and ask for support in the respective channels
   - Write Tests - We follow TDD (Test Driven Development) here at RDS. So if your code can have test then it should have test. In the same PR as the feature. No "I will make a PR for tests later" barring extreme circumstances. 
   - Just like a real job, you are expected to keep you team in loop. Specially the delays. Intimate your App Owner or Ankush in case of delays in your tasks. That doesn't mean you can't have delays. Delays are okay. Software estimations are hard even for experienced developer. It takes time to get decent at them.
   - Just like a real job, you can take leaves but be sure to mark yourself OOO(Out of Office) in the #OOO channel in Discord.
